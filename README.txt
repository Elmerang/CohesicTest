This is my submission for the Cohesic Test for an Intermediate Developer

You can run the project by typing

py cohesicTest.py 

in the CohesicTest folder

You can run the tests by typing

py cohesicTestUnitTests.py

in the folder CohesicTest

I did not implement the visual display and interaction exactly as the examples supplied in the question because it does say in the test that we cn implement the interface any way we like. 

So in my sample, you have to enter in the number corresponding to the chest part to select it or deselect it rather than typing text.
